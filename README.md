# The Coffee Co

As a massive coffee love i wanted to create something that i am passion about not. Not something that just gives me my morning kick. I have decided to create this fully featured online coffee shop. This ecommerce application allows users to browser products, make purchases, leave product reviews and post site tesimonials. This store ranges from fresh coffee, pod coffee, coffee machines and accessories.

## User Experience 

I wanted to create an ecommerce web based application allowing make purcases whilst registered and unregistered. Each product has a corresponding product image with name, descriotion and price. Users can add items to their cart, update and remove items. Once satisfied they can make an online purchase. Users can regiser for a user account where we can store their address information also. Staff users have access to add products, edit exisiting products and remove products at their own wish.

With the user stories in mind, I created the below strategy table using MOSCOW principles.

Each story was assigned a classification of Must-Have, Should-Have, Could-Have or Won't Have. Each story was also assigned user story points,
